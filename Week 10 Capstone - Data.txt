Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

Data:
I will be web scraping wikipedia for data tables. By exploring wikipedia, I should be able to get Name, Type, County, Population, population growth, and land area for each city. I will use Foursquare location data to compare the top cities.
